# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
This analysis uses machine learning to classify risky loans by processing loan data.  If this can be achieved with accuracy, it would provide a more efficient way to approve or deny loans, and reduce the risk for the lending institution.  
A number of machine learning models are tested to see which ones produced the best results.
